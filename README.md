## TO DO
### Technical Indicators - Feature Engineering
* Complete calculations for technical indicators
> * Dynamic Momentum Index
> * Stochastic Oscillator
> * Keltner Channel
> * Donchian Channel
* Compare Types of Indicators: (1) Momentum, (2) Trend, (3) Volume, (4) Volatility
* Feature Engineering: stock options, options markets, put-call ratio, implied and statistucal volatility 

### Modeling Considerations
* Experiment with time periods used for (1) lagging and leading indicators, (2) LSTM look-back, and (3) training sample sequences
* Model Evaluation: (1) Walk Forward Validation, (2) Back Testing, (3) train-test splits
